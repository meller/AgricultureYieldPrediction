This is a great approach for creating a high-impact "wow moment" in your lecture.Let's focus on a highly relevant and visually compelling topic: Precision Agriculture Yield Prediction and Nutrient Optimization.🎯 Recommended Topic: Interactive Yield Response AnalysisThis project demonstrates how AI can immediately inform a research decision (which nitrogen level is optimal).The "Wow" Moment: Generating an interactive 3D scatter plot or a dynamic Heatmap using the powerful Plotly library in Streamlit. Plotly is the best choice for scientific visualization in Python because it creates charts that users can pan, zoom, and hover over (unlike static Matplotlib charts).🌟 The Visual Library: Plotly ExpressPlotly Express is a high-level API for Plotly that makes generating complex, interactive charts extremely fast—which is perfect for "Vibe Coding." You can generate a stunning interactive chart in just one line of code.How to Code the Wow Moment (Vibe Prompt):"Using the loaded DataFrame, create an interactive Plotly Express scatter plot showing the relationship between Nitrogen_Level on the X-axis, Rainfall on the Y-axis, and color-code the points by the predicted Yield from the AI model. Make sure the chart is displayed in Streamlit."🌾 Real Data (Synthetic but Realistic Tabular Dataset)Since I cannot directly provide a file, here is a realistic, structured dataset you can copy/paste into a file named yield_data.csv in your Streamlit project folder. This data simulates experimental results across different conditions.RegionCrop_TypeNitrogen_Level (kg/ha)Phosphorus (kg/ha)Rainfall (mm)Avg_Temp (C)Yield (Tons/Ha)NorthWheat1205065024.57.8SouthWheat1806072023.08.9NorthWheat1504568025.08.5CenterCorn2008090028.010.2CenterCorn1507085027.59.1SouthCorn1006575026.08.4NorthWheat1005560024.06.9CenterCorn2509095028.511.0SouthCorn1207578026.58.8NorthWheat1705070025.08.7SouthCorn1608082027.09.8CenterWheat1306070026.07.9NorthCorn1808588027.09.9SouthWheat1105062023.57.2CenterCorn2209592029.010.5The Full AI and Data Processing Demo FlowHere is the step-by-step process you can demonstrate using VS Code and Copilot:Vibe Prompt 1 (Data Prep): Ask Copilot to write the code to load yield_data.csv and display the DataFrame in Streamlit.Vibe Prompt 2 (AI/Scientific Implementation): Ask Copilot to run a simple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn to predict Yield based on Nitrogen_Level, Rainfall, and Avg_Temp. (This is the AI/science part).Vibe Prompt 3 (The Wow Moment): Ask Copilot to create the Plotly Express scatter plot described above, using the variables from the DataFrame.This flow uses Copilot for the heavy lifting (Vibe Coding), Pandas and SciKit-learn for scientific processing, and Streamlit/Plotly for the "wow" visualization.Would you like me to generate the full Python script combining the data loading, the simple SciKit-learn model, and the Plotly visualization, ready for you to paste into app.py?

I want to create this demo app, what do you think ?
